This lib is used for the Tetris game. It should be added to your Arduino
library folder. The main modification is to allow direct access to the
sprite buffer for faster blitting, as gfx are stored in the correct format
to go straight to the display! There is no need to use this modified lib
unless you wish to compile the Tetris game.

Original library is here:
